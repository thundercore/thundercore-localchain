## ThunderCore Local Chain
We are proud to release ThunderCore Local Chain‚ö°Ô∏è to allow you to deploy and test your DApps on your local setup!

The ThunderCore Local Chain implementation is based on [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) and contains a ThunderCore module which acts as an abstraction interface to ThunderCore‚Äôs consensus protocol([more details](#important)). Each Local Chain will run as a single node, so you can get the source code, build, and run in your local environment!

## <a name="important"></a>Importantüö©
ThunderCore Local Chain generates blocks with Thunder's block headers, but it does **NOT** implement ThunderCore‚Äôs consensus protocol _yet_. These local chains, therefore, do **NOT** include the proposal and voting process of the Thunder protocol _yet_. 

To stay updated with ThunderCore's development and open-source efforts, visit our [website](https://www.thundercore.com/) and follow our social media.

## Building from source

Clone the repository to a directory on your local,

    # git clone https://github.com/thundercore/thundercore-localchain.git

Make sure you have Go compiler installed,

on Mac OS,

    # brew install go

on Ubuntu,

    # sudo apt-get install -y build-essential golang

on Fedora,

    # sudo dnf install -y golang

Build the local chain binary,

    # make thunder

Build the whole suite,

    # make all

## Start ThunderCore Local Chain

### Create an account
Find a folder and run `thunderlocal account new` from shell and set a password when prompted,

    # thunderlocal account new --datadir ./datadir
    Your new account is locked with a password. Please give a password. Do not forget this password.
    Passphrase:
    Repeat passphrase:
    Address: {0af454242c456d1fc25c1d74a56a00a816ec336b}

This command will create an account and account information is saved in `./datadir/keystore/UTC--XXX`

### Create a genesis JSON file
We can prefund the account created above. Please note the `"alloc" `block. And name the file as, for example `thunder.json`

    {
        "config": {
            "chainId": 3606,
            "homesteadBlock": 0,
            "eip150Block": 0,
            "eip155Block": 0,
            "eip158Block": 0,
            "byzantiumBlock": 0,
            "thunder": {
            }
        },
        "nonce": "0x0",
        "gasLimit": "0x989680",
        "difficulty": "0x1",
        "mixHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
        "coinbase": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
        "alloc": {
            "0x0af454242c456d1fc25c1d74a56a00a816ec336b" : { "balance": "1000000000000000000000000000000000000000" }
        },
        "number": "0x0",
        "gasUsed": "0x0",
        "parentHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
    }

Please note the `"thunder"` block in the JSON file, which is reserved to utilize Thunder's consensus engine in the future. 


For more information about ThunderCore's consensus engine:
>
1. For a high level understanding, read [Litepaper](https://docs.thundercore.com/thunder-litepaper.pdf)
2. For a slightly more detailed protocol specification, read [Whitepaper](https://docs.thundercore.com/thunder-whitepaper.pdf)
3. For security proofs, read the full paper [Thunderella: Blockchains with Optimistic
Instant Confirmation](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/913.pdf)

Alternatively, we can also create such genesis JSON file by [using setup wizard, puppeth](#puppeth).

### <a name="initchain"></a>Initialize the chain

    # thunderlocal init thunder.json --datadir ./datadir

### Start the chain

    # thunderlocal --datadir ./datadir  --networkid 3606 --rpc --rpcport "8545" --rpccorsdomain "*" --rpcapi "db,eth,net,miner,web3,personal" --nodiscover  --mine

Now, you should be good to go!üéâ Try to send some transactions or deploy your smart contract!

### Interactive Javascript console

    # thunderlocal attach http://127.0.0.1:8545

### <a name="puppeth"></a>Use puppeth to initialize genesis JSON config

`puppeth` is built when you build the whole suite by running `make all`. Start the wizard from command line,

    # puppeth

    Please specify a network name to administer (no spaces or hyphens, please)
    > thunder

    What would you like to do? (default = stats)
    1. Show network stats
    2. Configure new genesis
    3. Track new remote server
    4. Deploy network components
    > 2

    Which consensus engine to use? (default = thunder)
    1. Ethash - proof-of-work
    2. Clique - proof-of-authority
    3. Thunder - thundercore
    > 3

    Which accounts should be pre-funded? (advisable at least one)
    > 0x8ddf4f3e475f5b5f10ec5bf3452f94830e9d2ce9

    Specify your chain/network ID if you want an explicit one (default = random)
    > 3606

    What would you like to do? (default = stats)
    1. Show network stats
    2. Manage existing genesis
    3. Track new remote server
    4. Deploy network components
    > 2

    1. Modify existing fork rules
    2. Export genesis configuration
    3. Remove genesis configuration
    > 2

    Which file to save the genesis into? (default = ThunderLocal.json)
    > thunder.json

Then, you can initialize then start chain as described [above](#initchain)
